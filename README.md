# Clock Widget
A cool widget for coders.
## Overview
This widget shows date and time in the form of dictionary.
## Screenshots
<img src="/clock_widget.jpg?raw=true" alt="Spash Screen" title= "Splash Screen"></br>
## Issue
I have given refresh time of the widget to be 2hrs(72,00,000). So, it might take a maximum 2 hours to update date, day, month. However time updates every minute.
